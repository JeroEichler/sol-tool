# SOL TOOL

The Serendipity Over Linked Data Search Tool (SOL-Tool) applies an query orchestration process in order to apply a set of serendipitous patterns to retrieve unexpected content. 

Serendipity patterns are used here to provide additional and unexpected data related to the query results. 

The SOL-Tool was developed in Java with the Jena framework [1], a well-stabilized framework for Linked Data query processing and data manipulation, and Java Concurrent API[2] to parallelize the task of invoking remote datasets. The source code of SOL-Tool core is available in [3].
